Staying the course is particularly fraught when it comes to growing an organization, because some teams always need more than you choose to provide. https://lethain.com/durably-excellent-teams/
The tradeoffs and timing between standardizing on what works, exploring for superior technology, and supporting adoption of superior technology are at the core of engineering strategy. https://lethain.com/magnitudes-of-exploration/
In particular, I've found metrics to be an extremely effective way to lead change with little or no organizational authority, and I wanted to write up how I've seen that work. https://lethain.com/guiding-broad-change-with-metrics/
Unless your problem is that people aren't trying hard, then the "work harder" mantra only breeds hero programmers whose heroic ways make it difficult for non-heroes to contribute meaningfully. https://lethain.com/doing-it-harder-and-hero-programming/
In this sense, treating your peers as your first team allows you to begin practicing your manager's job, without having to get promoted into the role first. https://lethain.com/first-team/
Mandates assume: Model-Document-Share assumes: If your circumstances and your organization's values align with the second list, then this approach may be more effective for you than making mandates. https://lethain.com/model-document-share/
Those never make sense." It took me a few years to glean a lesson from that experience, but it comes to mind frequently now when I work with folks who are just starting to present to executives. https://lethain.com/presenting-to-executives/
Crisp boundaries are also important as they provide folks within a ladder a useful mental model of where they are in their journey, who their peers are, and who they should view as role models. https://lethain.com/perf-management-system/
It's best to do this slowly to maintain slack in the team, but if it's a choice of moving folks rapidly or scope rapidly, I've found the later is more effective and less disruptive. https://lethain.com/case-against-top-down-global-optimization/
This vastness also means that you, as a manager, can't simply give folks a career path: you'll inevitably steer them towards the most obvious avenues and through avoidable competition. https://lethain.com/career-narratives/
I've worked on a few teams where folks consistently looked out for each other, and believed they'd all come out better together. https://lethain.com/first-team/
Incorporate everything you've learned into your strategy document, and you're done. https://lethain.com/setting-organizational-direction/
For direct feedback from candidates, in my "manager interview" sessions, I've started to ask every candidate how the process has been and what we could do to improve. https://lethain.com/running-humane-interview-process/
Overall, this isn't a book I'd recommend, since it's a bit light on ideas and heavy on self-promotion, but I'm glad I read it as I imagine it'll be referenced a fair amount. https://lethain.com/2019-feb-mgmt-books/
Only your trained engineers can go oncall, they're oncall one week a month, and are busy about half their time oncall. https://lethain.com/productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth/
I've personally found rapidly growing companies to  be the best environments to meet folks at work, as you and everyone else will be in rapidly  evolving roles, and lots of new folks are always starting. https://lethain.com/meeting-people/
The act of writing a strategy leads folks through a systematic analysis, so even if we don't share them, writing these documents has helped us work through quite a few challenges, both overwhelming and mundane. https://lethain.com/strategies-visions/
You can't fix everything at once, so you'll often be doing something mediocre at any given point in time, but remember to come back and improve it when you can (e.g. paying down your management debt). https://lethain.com/philosophy-of-management/
This is also when you'll want to start skip-level 1:1s to ensure that there are direct, open channels for feedback  about your managers and your teams. https://lethain.com/tools-for-operating-a-growing-org/
Known solutions are amenable to iterative improvement, so it would make sense for execution to be highly valued, but in practice I find that ideas–especially ideas that are new within your company–are most highly prized. https://lethain.com/managing-growth-plates/
Invest explicitly with clear thresholds a new business line needs to hit before   receiving additional funding. https://lethain.com/headcount-dilemmas/
There absolutely is not a single right way to present to senior leaders, but hopefully the template is a useful starting point. https://lethain.com/presenting-to-executives/
I advocate 70% towards immediate user needs, because I think folks tend to over index on the future, and this helps avoid falling into that trap. https://lethain.com/product-management-infra-engineering/
We've looked a bit at productivity's tortured relationship with engineering headcount, so now let's also think a bit about how the load on your systems is growing. https://lethain.com/productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth/
Now that you've decided to create a decision making group, it's time to get into the choices! https://lethain.com/scaling-consistency/
Folks want to work at companies whose mission they belief in, with peers they appreciate, but I find most folks will sacrifice both if they believe they're missing out on compensation to do so. https://lethain.com/talent-distributions/
At the foundation of an effective performance management system are career ladders, which describe the expected behaviors and responsibilities for a role. https://lethain.com/perf-management-system/
I distinctly remember one asking me for advice on how to handle a situation, and I told them this was an opportunity to develop their own style of management, and there wasn't any one way to do it: do what feels natural and it'll work out. https://lethain.com/rails-for-engineering-leadership/
Combine efforts on opportunity and membership, and you will find yourself solidly on the path to an inclusive organization. https://lethain.com/membership-opportunity/
You'll spend the majority of your time refining approaches that work effectively for your team, a bit of your time documenting how you did it, and almost no time trying to convince folks to change their approach. https://lethain.com/model-document-share/
Migrations matter because they are usually the only available avenue to make meaningful progress on technical debt. https://lethain.com/migrations/
This works particularly well if you extend an open invitation to folks in that role to improve their ladder! https://lethain.com/perf-management-system/
One place I had to entirely change my habits was around selecting folks to lead important projects. https://lethain.com/inclusion-in-the-first-shift/
Projects fail slowly, fixing them takes time too. https://lethain.com/doing-it-harder-and-hero-programming/
With such a broad problem domain filled with so many possible solutions, I've sometimes found it difficult to provide guidance for infrastructure teams to prioritize their work. https://lethain.com/infrastructure-planning/
The organization will never stop growing, but each team will. https://lethain.com/durably-excellent-teams/
Now that you've design your organization for the next year or so, it's surprisingly powerful to extend your planning horizon a bit further. https://lethain.com/how-to-evolve-eng-org/
Once you've accounted for the impact of organizational design, the most literal levers for increasing the talent distribution of your company are performance management and compensation strategy. https://lethain.com/talent-distributions/
As a company ages, it will inevitable add levels to support career progression. https://lethain.com/career-levels-and-more/
Like technical debt, these risks linger because they are never the most pressing problem. https://lethain.com/organizational-risk/
Rather than talking about each input metric in detail, instead you can start setting goals around shifting the distribution of grades. https://lethain.com/metrics-for-the-unmeasurable/
I've written a lot, although in another sense I've only just begun to write what can be and what needs to be written about developing and operating as a leader in engineering. https://lethain.com/rails-for-engineering-leadership/
Vulnerability is one of my core management and leadership skills, and that’s funny, because I’m absolutely not someone who’s inherently comfortable sharing much about myself. https://lethain.com/vulnerability/
Succession planning is thinking through how the organization would function without you, documenting those gaps, and starting to fill them in. https://lethain.com/succession-planning/
The goal is to make this email as dense as possible, and assume many folks will only read the Brief, and most who keep reading will do so to skim the Metrics for surprising trends before moving on. https://lethain.com/how-write-group-emails-at-work/
The most impactful changes I've made to how I manage time are: As you start using more of these approaches, you won't immediately find yourself less busy, but will gradually start to finish more work. https://lethain.com/time-management/
When you have surplus engineering capacity, folks tend to have a long backlog of stuff they’d like to work on, and many teams immediately jump on those, but I think it’s useful to fight that instinct and to step back and do deliberate discovery. https://lethain.com/product-management-infra-engineering/
Finally, the other major contribution you can make to nurturing your team is to make sure that everyone on your team should be on your team, this is also sometimes called performance management. https://lethain.com/adding-value-as-an-engineering-manager/
The aim of this email is to provide enough context and information for folks without background in a topic to appreciate why it's important and why what's been done is impressive. https://lethain.com/how-write-group-emails-at-work/
A good interview experience starts with being kind to your candidate. https://lethain.com/running-humane-interview-process/
When we talk about measuring security, it's pretty easy to identify output metrics that describe your desired outcomes. https://lethain.com/metrics-for-the-unmeasurable/
Spending an extra two days intentionally making your documentation clean and tools intuitive can save years in large migrations. https://lethain.com/migrations/
While I’m really excited at how this approach has helped us focus on directly supporting our users, it’s still an early approach. https://lethain.com/product-management-infra-engineering/

I've followed this rule very literally, staying at least two years (well, we can all count here, exactly two years) at each company I've worked at, and starting each job with the hope that this one would be the place I'd make it to four. https://lethain.com/roles-over-rocket-ships/
Altogether, there are four interesting questions to dig into: At the end, creating a new role will still be a difficult decision, but we'll be armed with a framework to help make it. https://lethain.com/specialized-roles/
This refined list of goals, aligned to your company's priorities, then becomes a central artifact for how you and your manager partner on your career evolution. https://lethain.com/career-narratives/
The two reasons applying policy consistently is particularly challenging are: When we've picked thoughtful constraints to allow us to accomplish important goals, we need the courage to bypass these opportunities and accept these local inefficiencies. https://lethain.com/work-policy-not-exceptions/
As I've gotten more experienced in defining and using metrics, more and more of my time is spent dealing with areas that defy easy measurement. https://lethain.com/metrics-for-the-unmeasurable/
Each time there was a change that meaningfully changed how you work, mark that down as a transition. https://lethain.com/roles-over-rocket-ships/
Now that you have your target organization size and target ratio of managers to engineers, it's time to figure out the general shape of your organization! https://lethain.com/running-an-engineering-reorg/
(Depending a bit on your learning style.)  In small companies, or as you get deep into your carer, you often find yourself experienced at tasks that the broader organization is unfamiliar with. https://lethain.com/growing-with-your-company/
Granting exceptions undermines folks sense of fairness, and sets a precedent that undermines future policy. https://lethain.com/work-policy-not-exceptions/
This isn't the only reason this transition is hard, it's also hard because a lot of your skills and habits stop working well. https://lethain.com/close-out-solve-or-delegate/
Organizational design isn't defined by approaching an ideological ideal, it's judged by its effectiveness at solving your current needs. https://lethain.com/how-to-evolve-eng-org/
I believe that the balancing of positive and negative freedoms is a fundamental task of managers and management. https://lethain.com/company-culture-and-managing-freedoms/

When I was working at Digg, I was fortunate enough to get five minutes of media training from Christine. https://lethain.com/briefest-of-media-trainings/
Sometimes a junior engineer might serve as a team lead. https://lethain.com/social-hierarchies-in-engineering-organizations/
In particular, I find it useful for avoiding some of the frequent mistakes made by infrastructure engineering teams: By systematically thinking through the six features during planning, I find it's harder for me to fall into those alluring mental traps. https://lethain.com/infrastructure-between-cost-center-and-before-ego-trip/
The link here shows that the time available for developing features depends on the number of trained managers. https://lethain.com/systems-thinking/
The foundation mode is a game of execution, focus and limiting work-in-progress, whereas the innovation mode is about listening to users, exploring solution spaces and an eternal focus on validating solutions as early and cheaply as possible. https://lethain.com/product-management-infra-engineering/
Trying to do all your learning outside of work is really hard, and in the long run, most folks find that the demands on their time and energy don't support learning outside of work as a means to keep up with this sort of rapidly growing role. https://lethain.com/growing-with-your-company/
If you don't add the brief, most folks won't read the email at all. https://lethain.com/how-write-group-emails-at-work/
Many folks will feel a significant loss of freedom when you create these groups, as their zone of decision making will be newly limited. https://lethain.com/scaling-consistency/
One candidate may end up managing the others. https://lethain.com/internal-candidates-for-senior-management/
The combination of level expansion and level drift leads to periodic bursts where a cohort of folks cross level boundaries together. https://lethain.com/career-levels-and-more/
If each migration takes a week, each team is eight engineers, and you're doing four migrations a year, then you're losing about 1% of your company's total productivity. https://lethain.com/productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth/
If you don't get effective at software and system migrations, you'll end up languishing in technical debt. https://lethain.com/migrations/
Working at a frenetic pace for a couple weeks or a month may feel like a major outpouring of effort and energy, but it's near impossible to quickly counteract a deficit created over months of poor implementation or management choices. https://lethain.com/doing-it-harder-and-hero-programming/
I've found measurability of opportunity to be surprisingly high, which is one of the reasons I think it's an effective pillar in thinking about inclusion. https://lethain.com/membership-opportunity/
Over time, it is common for the career level to experience level drift, leading to increasingly distinct clusters of folks who reached career level at its highest expectations and folks who have reached it recently. https://lethain.com/career-levels-and-more/
Meet with peer companies and ask them what they're focused on. https://lethain.com/setting-organizational-direction/
Organizations spending significant time on exceptions as experiencing exception debt, and the escape is to stop working the exceptions, and instead work the policy. https://lethain.com/work-policy-not-exceptions/
Once you've handled as much of the migration programmatically as possible, figure out the self-service tooling and documentation you can provide to allow folks to make the necessary changes without getting stuck. https://lethain.com/migrations/
Let's tackle hiring first, as hiring and training are often a team's biggest time investment. https://lethain.com/productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth/
For the data pipeline example, a few of the baseline metrics might be: Baseline metrics are useful for narrowing the solution space you explore in order to accomplish your investment goals. https://lethain.com/goals-and-baselines/
When considering the Model-Document-Share approach works, it's interesting to compare it with the top-down mandate. https://lethain.com/model-document-share/
Once you have those problems, return to your rounds of engaging with experienced leaders at other companies, and ask them how they've made those tradeoffs before. https://lethain.com/setting-organizational-direction/
Particularly in cases where ownership is extremely diffuse, I believe cautiously authoritative groups do increase net positive freedom for folks with little reduction to negative freedom. https://lethain.com/scaling-consistency/
We model in a fixed rate of project reprioritization, one per round, and remove repriortized projects from our finish rate, since we won't finish projects we stop working on. https://lethain.com/limiting-wip/
That said, the most reliable ways to stay in touch with folks are the most obvious: send them a thoughtful note, or meet them a couple times a year for coffee. https://lethain.com/meeting-people/
Related posts: Durably good teams require good composition: some folks earlier in their career, some later in their career, a reasonable ratio of managers to engineers, and so on. https://lethain.com/special-topics-org-design/
You'll find yourself sizing teams during reorganizations, to accommodate growth from hiring, and when considering how to support new projects. https://lethain.com/sizing-engineering-teams/
This is so important that I've come to believe that having a wide cohort of folks who lead critical projects is one of the most important signifiers of good organizational health. https://lethain.com/selecting-project-leads/
This "no" is explaining your team's constraints to folks outside the team, and it's one of the most important activities you undertake as an engineering leader. https://lethain.com/saying-no/

DeMarco shares a vision of middle management as the layer where organizations learn and remember. https://lethain.com/slack-and-hope-for-middle-management/
It also maintains working on policy as a leveraged operation for leadership, avoiding the toilsome robes of an exceptions judge. https://lethain.com/work-policy-not-exceptions/
As we sat down to iterate on our infrastructure prioritization framework, the things we particularly wanted to improve were: We spent some time reflecting on what did and didn't work well in the previous iteration, as well as those goals for improvement. https://lethain.com/infrastructure-planning/
Some of the aspects I've found useful to consider during this phase are: Once you've narrowed down the problem you want to solve, it's easy to jump directly into execution, but that can make it easy to fall in love with a difficult approach. https://lethain.com/intro-product-management/
You don't have to switch to using kanban, although I've found it very effective for debugging team performance, just populate the board once to expose your current constraints. https://lethain.com/saying-no/
Once you're able to explain your constraints and where time is being spent, then you're having a useful conversation about whether you can shift time from other behaviors towards your constraints. https://lethain.com/saying-no/
The best way to avoid such unintended outcomes is to pair your investment goals with baseline metrics, sometimes referred to as countervailing metrics. https://lethain.com/goals-and-baselines/
If you skip to supporting the team tactically before initiating the correct system solution, you'll exhaust yourself with no promise of salvation. https://lethain.com/durably-excellent-teams/

Now that we're starting projects at a slower rate, we're able to finish many, many more tasks. https://lethain.com/limiting-wip/
Working at a company isn't a single continuous experience, rather it's a mix of stable eras and periods of rapid change that bridge between eras. https://lethain.com/roles-over-rocket-ships/
It's suggested that mature companies have more stable periods and startups a greater propensity for change, but it's been my experience that what matters most is the particular team you join. https://lethain.com/roles-over-rocket-ships/
The number of approaches to performance management is uncountably vast, but most of them are composed of three elements: The purpose of these combined systems is to focus the company's efforts towards activities that help the company succeed. https://lethain.com/perf-management-system/
You're now working on five disparate projects, trying not to piss too many people off, but you're having trouble getting everyone involved. https://lethain.com/doing-it-harder-and-hero-programming/
Today, if someone asked me how to build an inclusive, diverse team, I’m still uncomfortable imagining what my answer. https://lethain.com/inclusion-in-the-first-shift/
If your team is aligned and doing good work, time spent writing these probably won't be too valuable. https://lethain.com/strategies-visions/
The members of such a team have shifted their first team from the folks they support to their peers. https://lethain.com/first-team/
A stock might be the number of trained managers at your company. https://lethain.com/systems-thinking/
The thing I enjoy most about this format is that it gives folks what they really want, spending time learning from each other, and is remarkably quick to prepare for as a facilitator. https://lethain.com/communities-of-learning/
Instead he's looking at line management opportunities in fast growing companies where he can go in with a small team and rapidly grow managerial scope as the company grows around him. https://lethain.com/finding-managerial-scope/
Design is a great word, because it implies the kind of careful thoughtfulness that great process does indeed possess. https://lethain.com/good-process-is-evolved/
User surveys - it’s surprisingly hard to write a great survey, and easy to create survey fatigue, but a good survey is an awesome way to get many folks to share input. https://lethain.com/product-management-infra-engineering/
Its message has a lot in common with It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work, but this book does a better job of prioritizing a cohesive message over self-promotion. https://lethain.com/2019-feb-mgmt-books/
However, we should pursue explorations that offers at least one order of magnitude improvement over the existing technology. https://lethain.com/magnitudes-of-exploration/
After you've evolved the design, the next step is to embed into the most challenging one or two teams, and work side by side with those teams to build, evolve and migrate to the new system. https://lethain.com/migrations/
(I'd like to prepend useful to things, but as best I can tell, my team's software was unilaterally thrown away, so that's hard to justify.) Something that experience didn't equip me well to do is partner with my manager. https://lethain.com/partnering-with-your-manager/
This works especially well in a gelled "first team", and recently I've been spending more time facilitating a broader learning community of engineering managers. https://lethain.com/communities-of-learning/
Previously, without the work-in-progress limit we only finished twelve projects in 100 rounds, but now with a work-in-progress limit we finish 198 tasks in the same 100 rounds. https://lethain.com/limiting-wip/

Over the past year, as I've transitioned into largely working with managers of managers, things shifted again. https://lethain.com/setting-organizational-direction/
Ideally, baselines are carried over across planning periods, and such that they frame the investment goals but don't require too much active discussion during any given planning cycle. https://lethain.com/goals-and-baselines/
When I started thinking of a useful example of where systems thinking is useful, one came to mind immediately. https://lethain.com/systems-thinking/
On the other hand, at quickly growing companies, I've also seen infrastructure teams become befuddled about their priorities and staff multiple, competing teams with the same goals. https://lethain.com/infrastructure-between-cost-center-and-before-ego-trip/
My experience is that companies with uniformly productive folks have an egalitarian bent, and those with multimodal productivity distributions prefer specialization or hierarchy. https://lethain.com/talent-distributions/
Every company says they value high performance teams and manage out folks with weaker performance, but most companies and managers are uncomfortable doing this. https://lethain.com/talent-distributions/
The two most common flavors of this I've seen are "product reviews" to standardize product decisions, and the "architecture group" to encourage consistent technical design. https://lethain.com/scaling-consistency/
Early in your management career, you'll have to figure out how to approach common challenges: interviewing, performance management, promotions, raises. https://lethain.com/philosophy-of-management/
Once you’ve validated a solution, you also want to keep in mind similar needs from other users. https://lethain.com/product-management-infra-engineering/
For example, folks on infrastructure teams are implicitly prioritizing security, scale and stability features useful for the largest business lines against the fast-iteration needs of smaller business lines. https://lethain.com/headcount-dilemmas/
Taking the time to evaluate which problem to solve is one of the best predictors I've found of a team's long-term performance. https://lethain.com/intro-product-management/
Depending on your culture and how you value consistency, there are an infinite number of approaches, and designing an effective decision making group depends on a handful of core decisions. https://lethain.com/scaling-consistency/
We have ideas around how to heal a burned team, we just need to figure out one more thing: how do we get people to take vacation? https://lethain.com/you-should-take-take-more-vacation/
Now you have a set of organizational risks that you're pretty confident will get fixed, and then you have all the others. https://lethain.com/organizational-risk/
As your organization grows, you'll incorporate more of these, but there's no need to go overboard: pick a couple, remember to use them, and you're well on the path to good organizational design. https://lethain.com/how-to-evolve-eng-org/
You'll be spending more time in your roadmaps as you: As you spend less time with your teams, you'll want to start a weekly staff meeting with your managers. https://lethain.com/tools-for-operating-a-growing-org/
Over the last month I've been reading Good Strategy, Bad Strategy during my commute, and it's been the most thought-provoking book I've read in some time. https://lethain.com/good-strategy-bad-strategy/
I recommend taking a four prong approach, learning about your users’ needs, what peer companies are doing, where industry leaders are going, and brainstorming with your team. https://lethain.com/product-management-infra-engineering/
Sometimes current needs don’t align well with the future, or the future is a long ways away, and in that case my rule of thumb is to invest 70% of your effort on solving immediate user needs, and 30% on advancing towards the future. https://lethain.com/product-management-infra-engineering/
I discussed the foundation of performance management systems in Designations, levels and calibrations, but the fundamentals can be a bit bland! https://lethain.com/career-levels-and-more/
In some problem domains, the product management skillset is extraordinarily effective for identifying useful problems, but systems thinking is the most universally useful toolkit I've found. https://lethain.com/systems-thinking/
The most frequent application will be using it as a guide for self-reflection and during career coaching 1:1s, but you'll also want to create formal feedback into the form of a performance designation. https://lethain.com/perf-management-system/
With your organization design and headcount planning, you can roughly determine when you'll need to fill each of the technical and management leadership positions. https://lethain.com/running-an-engineering-reorg/
There's a pervasive trope that folks who've worked an extended period in a large company will struggle to adapt to working in a smaller company. https://lethain.com/roles-over-rocket-ships/
That's because parts of the company are growing rapidly, with an emphasis on execution, and other parts have largely stabilized, with ideas becoming the more valued currency. https://lethain.com/managing-growth-plates/
I call it Model, Document, and Share. https://lethain.com/model-document-share/
If we are in the office twelve hours a day, and rarely take vacations, then our teams will feel compelled to work long and rest seldom. https://lethain.com/you-should-take-take-more-vacation/
These long hours burn your heroes out, and then they either quit or you shove them into a corner where they'll glower at you while remembering how their hard work and critical contributions culminated in them glaring at you from that corner. https://lethain.com/doing-it-harder-and-hero-programming/
Have you ever worked at a company where the same two people always got the most important projects? https://lethain.com/selecting-project-leads/
Brimming with research and user needs, I try to create three artifacts: A charter that identifies the unique value your team tries to provide, your competitive advantages and the strategy that you’ll employ. https://lethain.com/product-management-infra-engineering/
You still have to attack the definition and find ways to get the team a reasonable workload with a mix of interesting work, but these can be useful for jumpstarting the process, getting you and your team out of mental deadlock and able to think again. https://lethain.com/healing-team-burnout/
About two years ago, I realized I was encountering more and more problems where I didn't know many folks who could provide advice, and at that point I started to get more intentional at building out my network. https://lethain.com/meeting-people/
What I needed was a way to coordinate my approach across teams, both in terms of very specific challenges and in terms of our long-term direction. https://lethain.com/strategies-visions/
Working on the system is a fairly simple iterative loop: The hard parts are measuring where your team is spending time, and picking good experiments for reducing the time you're spending on it. https://lethain.com/adding-value-as-an-engineering-manager/
As you learn, you become experienced at more and more tasks, shrinking the learning bucket, and making you more effective in your current role. https://lethain.com/growing-with-your-company/
If you took ten minutes to ask a dozen folks about their immediate career goals, I suspect that for eleven of them it would center on either getting promoted or switching companies to reach the next evolution of their current job. https://lethain.com/career-narratives/
Many hiring managers freeze up when their referral network starts to dry up or as they look to bring a wider set of backgrounds onto their teams, but the good news is that there is a simple answer: cold sourcing. https://lethain.com/cold-sourcing/
Many folks start migrations by generating tracking tickets for teams to implement, but it's better to slow down and build tooling to programmatically migrate the easy ninety-percent. https://lethain.com/migrations/
Finishes is particularly important, as opposed to does, because partial work has no value, and your team's defining constraints are often in the finishing stages. https://lethain.com/saying-no/
If hard work and breeding heroes doesn't work, what does? https://lethain.com/doing-it-harder-and-hero-programming/
Standardizing technology is a powerful way to create leverage: improve tooling a bit and every engineer will get more productive. https://lethain.com/magnitudes-of-exploration/
A structure that I've found extremely effective is described in Good Strategy, Bad Strategy, and has three sections: diagnosis, policies and actions. https://lethain.com/strategies-visions/
Learning forward, I've started to weave in a number of additional ideas in the vain quest for a unified theory of management. https://lethain.com/philosophy-of-management/
The most effective way to provide opportunity to the members of your organization is through structured application of good process. https://lethain.com/membership-opportunity/
Instead of ending your funnel at closing candidates, add four more phases: Not many companies extend their hiring funnel this way, but I think it's quite useful, reframing hiring from a transactional process into your organization's lifeblood. https://lethain.com/hiring-funnel/
For a very long time, this discomfort prevented me from discovering one of the most rewarding elements of being in a supportive work environment: building a community of learning with your peers. https://lethain.com/communities-of-learning/
The major challenges I've encountered rolling out new roles are: If we do want to create a new role, it's important to take stock of what we'll need to do to make folks in the role successful. https://lethain.com/specialized-roles/
You already know if an internal candidate has hired managers. https://lethain.com/internal-candidates-for-senior-management/
As a corrolary, having a clear deprecation path   for new business lines is a powerful enabler of this kind of thing. https://lethain.com/headcount-dilemmas/
They're still a junior engineer. https://lethain.com/social-hierarchies-in-engineering-organizations/
When I started managing, my leadership philosophy was simple: These have served well as a foundation, but by applying them repeatedly over time and circumstance, I've seen them fray on the edge cases. https://lethain.com/philosophy-of-management/
There are some tricks you can use to help with this–try scheduling one day a week only working on management work–but I think the real issue here is that many managers don't believe that managers can really contribute much of value to their team. https://lethain.com/adding-value-as-an-engineering-manager/
In particular, starting but not finishing migrations often incurs significant technical debt, so your incentives and recognition structure should be careful to avoid perverse incentives. https://lethain.com/migrations/
Of the two, managing organizational change is more general so let's work through a lightly structured framework for (re)designing an engineering organization. https://lethain.com/running-an-engineering-reorg/
Benchmarking is a remarkably sound technique to cheaply   determine the range of reasonable solutions,   and I'd recommend it as the initial approach to solving almost any   organizational problem, including sizing. https://lethain.com/how-to-evolve-eng-org/
While nodes have swapped positions, the hierarchy of roles remains alive and well, which at its clearest when folks propose creating a job description or career ladder for a new role. https://lethain.com/specialized-roles/
As you roll these out, measuring remains extremely important, although I've found membership rather harder to measure than opportunity. https://lethain.com/membership-opportunity/
As a manager, your obligation is to identify the correct system solution for a given transition, initiate that solution, and then support the team as best you can to create space for the solutions to work their magic. https://lethain.com/durably-excellent-teams/
What I've seen work best is to be tolerant of career ladder proliferation–really try to make a ladder for each unique role–but to only invest significant time in refining any given ladder as it becomes applicable for more folks. https://lethain.com/perf-management-system/
This will save your time, build folks' trust in the system, and move you from working the exceptions to working the policy. https://lethain.com/work-policy-not-exceptions/
After experimenting with a handful of different approaches, agreeing on strategy and vision has been the most effective approach I've found to alignment at scale. https://lethain.com/strategies-visions/
When things in your area are going poorly, you'll be swamped with more direction and input than you can readily absorb, but when things are going well, you'll often be responsible for supplying your own direction and that for your team. https://lethain.com/setting-organizational-direction/
At a small startup or in a rapidly growing companies growth-plates, you're mostly dealing with new problems. https://lethain.com/managing-growth-plates/
Infrastructure offers these six major features to company and client: This is certainly not a comprehensive framework, but I have found it to be quite useful during planning sessions. https://lethain.com/infrastructure-between-cost-center-and-before-ego-trip/
Before you release that email you're writing to spin up a new centralized decision-making group, it's worth talking about the four ways these groups consistently fail. https://lethain.com/scaling-consistency/
If it's more important than your current work, shift priorities at your next planning session. https://lethain.com/saying-no/
In order to prioritize hiring for scenarios where it'll do the most good, over the past year I've developed a loose framework for reasoning about what a given team needs to increase performance. https://lethain.com/durably-excellent-teams/
Frame it as a short experiment with the team, and start trying it. https://lethain.com/model-document-share/
Once you're measuring how the current organization, the next step is to determine your target organizational size. https://lethain.com/how-to-evolve-eng-org/
If you have a poor relationship with your manager or a member of your team, spend even more time with them. https://lethain.com/philosophy-of-management/
Strategies are grounded documents which explain the tradeoffs and actions that will be taken to address a specific challenge. https://lethain.com/strategies-visions/
Every engineering team I've been a part of has eventually started a technical paper reading group. https://lethain.com/hosting-paper-reading-group/
A strategy is an approach to a challenge that recommends specific actions that address the challenge's constraints. https://lethain.com/strategies-visions/
When I start writing an email, I try to answer two questions: who is my audience? https://lethain.com/how-write-group-emails-at-work/
Talk to five slightly larger companies and build a small dataset   of how they've sized their organization. https://lethain.com/how-to-evolve-eng-org/
Your goal as a leader is to offload work that you are experienced at to the wider organization as rapidly as possible, freeing up room for you to continue learning. https://lethain.com/growing-with-your-company/
A couple of years ago I put together an infrastructure planning framework I referred to as the five properties of infrastructure, which worked well at a certain degree of complexity, but recently hasn't been providing the degree of guidance we needed. https://lethain.com/infrastructure-planning/
How are you helping your teams take vacation? https://lethain.com/you-should-take-take-more-vacation/
Last in the list is yourself, but while I do believe you should generally put yourself last, it's also a reminder to remember to "pay yourself." Burnout is endemic in our industry, and a burned out manager often leaks onto their team. https://lethain.com/philosophy-of-management/
There is a long way to go, but reflecting on the progress over the past year, I can be authentically optimistic that anyone–even me!–can learn to nurture an inclusive, diverse organization that folks are proud to participate in. https://lethain.com/inclusion-in-the-first-shift/
Every bad process I've encountered had one of these three problems: Designing great process requires honest alignment on goals, methodical approach, and a great deal of thoughtful attention. https://lethain.com/good-process-is-evolved/
Write a design document and shop it with the teams that you believe will have the hardest time migrating. https://lethain.com/migrations/
Once you've established that your projects are infact valuable, the next endeavour is to help guide those projects to success without making yourself the bottleneck on your team's execution. https://lethain.com/adding-value-as-an-engineering-manager/
Perhaps unsurprisingly,  most of their teams believe they have urgent hiring needs. https://lethain.com/durably-excellent-teams/
This leads to teams that are already well-staffed continuing to create the most compelling requests and to gain the most additional resources. https://lethain.com/capturing-resources/
The book is An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management. https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/
Mostly standardize, exploration should drive order of magnitude improvement, and limit concurrent explorations. https://lethain.com/magnitudes-of-exploration/
We model that in by adjusting the finish rate to factor in the number of started tasks. https://lethain.com/limiting-wip/
When users ask to understand why we're doing infrastructure work instead of an alternative project, we can explicitly connect our investments to business value. https://lethain.com/infrastructure-planning/
So that's a total impact of five hours per week for your trained engineers, who are now down to 0.275 efficiency, and your team overall is now getting less than the output of a single trained engineer for every three engineers you've hired. https://lethain.com/productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth/
As your organization's needs evolve, you'll want to realign your organization to fit with them, which will run into friction of folks who the current organization was designed around. https://lethain.com/special-topics-org-design/
I've experimented with a number of approaches, and here is what I've found most effective for me: Meeting people at work is by far the most effective way to build a large network. https://lethain.com/meeting-people/
A good example of this is if you imagine creating a "server security grade", where you assign every server a letter grade from "A" to "F" based on its input metrics. https://lethain.com/metrics-for-the-unmeasurable/
The two most common models I've seen are: The full ownership model leads to a tighter talent distribution, where most folks across the company are experiencing similar productivity. https://lethain.com/talent-distributions/
I believe that's because managers represent a different skill set, one which most engineers don't particularly aspire towards. https://lethain.com/social-hierarchies-in-engineering-organizations/
This week I've been thinking about The Goal, how to finish more work, and what a model for productivity would look like. https://lethain.com/limiting-wip/
The person in that role will often become a bottleneck on the company's execution, and their rate of learning will decrease even more as they refocus on work they've already mastered. https://lethain.com/growing-with-your-company/
Calibrations are rounds of reviewing performance designations and reviews, with the aim of ensuring ratings are consistent and fair across teams, organizations and the company overall. https://lethain.com/perf-management-system/
Some rules of thumb to consider while you're identifying scope for groups and teams are: You can go surprisingly far with the above atoms and rules for structuring organizations. https://lethain.com/how-to-evolve-eng-org/
I'm far from a seasoned facilitator, and I've also found this format to be a rewarding and safe opportunity for me to grow as a facilitator. https://lethain.com/communities-of-learning/
Like most important endeavours, building a good relationship with a large number of folks requires years of ongoing effort. https://lethain.com/meeting-people/
What are the ways that you see managers get stuck? https://lethain.com/ways-engineering-managers-get-stuck/
Based on the answers, I pick one of four formats: Brief: a concise email, which conveys information, bolds key components and links to background context. https://lethain.com/how-write-group-emails-at-work/
Once you’ve structured selecting folks to lead projects, another important step is recognizing them! https://lethain.com/inclusion-in-the-first-shift/
Both can lead to difficult to understand resourcing decisions, typically taking the format of allocating resources across sufficient projects that none is well staffed. https://lethain.com/capturing-resources/
Within organizational debt, there is a volatile subset most likely to come abruptly due, and I call that subset organizational risk. https://lethain.com/organizational-risk/
I think this resonates with everyone's transition to managing managers: it's an unsettling period when you lose access to what used to make you happy–partnering directly with a team–and haven't found new sources of self-worth in your work. https://lethain.com/close-out-solve-or-delegate/
Every few years I spend a month or two reading some general business and management books. https://lethain.com/2019-feb-mgmt-books/
For each state, here is the strategic solution that I've found most effective, along with some ideas around how to support the team while they come to fruition: I can't stress enough that these fixes are slow. https://lethain.com/durably-excellent-teams/
Test the list on a few folks that you work closely with and see if you've missed anything. https://lethain.com/succession-planning/
One mechanism I've found that implicitly starves short-term work prioritizing   revenue-generating business lines is when KTLO work is not fully funded. https://lethain.com/headcount-dilemmas/
My experience is that you can't conduct a kind, candidate-centric interview process if your interviewers are tightly time constrained. https://lethain.com/running-humane-interview-process/
Migrations are the only mechanism to effectively manage technical debt as your company and code grows. https://lethain.com/migrations/
I wouldn’t have picked either of these traits, and while I’m trying hard to get better at the latter, I think success as a leader is about simultaneously improving yourself and building a leadership style that works with who you are today. https://lethain.com/vulnerability/
In fact, over 100 rounds, this model accomplishes 2,520 tasks, more than ten times the tasks we finished in the model with a weaker feedback loop above. https://lethain.com/limiting-wip/
If you catch the problem early, there are two paths out: limit work-in-progress, and hire into the affected teams. https://lethain.com/fire-fixation/
Related posts: If you have no external managers, you're going to reinvent every management best practice from scratch. https://lethain.com/special-topics-org-design/
Projects fail all the time, people screw up all the time. https://lethain.com/doing-it-harder-and-hero-programming/
Organizational change is so disruptive to so many people that I've increasingly come to believe you should drive organizational design from the boxes and not from the key individuals. https://lethain.com/running-an-engineering-reorg/
I realized this was an area of opportunity for the broader team, and we developed a structured process for selecting project leaders. https://lethain.com/inclusion-in-the-first-shift/
Many companies decide to perform a level split: separating the career level into two halves. https://lethain.com/career-levels-and-more/
When I think about having access to opportunity, I think about ensuring that folks can go home most days feeling fulfilled by challenge and growth. https://lethain.com/membership-opportunity/
Folks running resourcing processes should be extremely skeptical of teams or leaders who make repeated requests for resources, particularly in private and outside of the defined resourcing and planning regime. https://lethain.com/capturing-resources/
When you want to start operationalizing your hiring process, the first step is to craft a process for how candidates will flow through this funnel. https://lethain.com/hiring-funnel/
Compared to the version of this model without reprioritization, we're still making progress, but we've cut our throughput in half, only finishing 101 projects over 100 rounds. https://lethain.com/limiting-wip/
The good news is that success here doesn't require innovation or novelty: adopt a structured approach and you'll quickly become an effective process designer. https://lethain.com/good-process-is-evolved/
This is part of why my proposed model recommends rapidly hiring into teams loaded down by technical debt, not on innovating teams, which avoids incurring re-gelling costs on high performing teams. https://lethain.com/case-against-top-down-global-optimization/
You've worked through a engineering reorganization. https://lethain.com/running-an-engineering-reorg/
Training a new manager is an inflow, and a trained manager who departs the company is an outflow. https://lethain.com/systems-thinking/
As managers looking to grow ourseles, what we should really be pursuing is scope: not enumerating people, but taking responsibility for the success of increasingly important and complex facets of the organization and company. https://lethain.com/finding-managerial-scope/
This is a tricky time, because the organization depends on you to deliver the work that only you're experienced with, while simultaneously depending on you to rapidly learn new skills that no one in the organization can teach you. https://lethain.com/growing-with-your-company/
The most important factor I've seen for effective performance cycles is forcing folks to practice. https://lethain.com/perf-management-system/
As a functional leader you'll be expected to set your own direction with little direction from others. https://lethain.com/setting-organizational-direction/
It's felt like a superpower to have a vocabulary to describe some of the poor decision making I've seen in the past, and more excitingly it's also given me a tool to see a great deal of good strategy that I was missing as well. https://lethain.com/good-strategy-bad-strategy/
If you see a team fascinated by their fires, take a moment to be proud of their urgent work, but then take immediate steps to dig them out. https://lethain.com/fire-fixation/
If this goes on long enough, the company must hire an external candidate who is either already experienced or has the time to learn. https://lethain.com/growing-with-your-company/
A peculiar challenge of management is trying to invest in someone's career development when they themselves are uncertain about their goals. https://lethain.com/career-narratives/
The only way to operate a consistently good hiring funnel is to ground your attention and efforts in your funnel metrics. https://lethain.com/hiring-funnel/
You can rehabilitate heroes, but it's touch and go from the beginning, and healing takes time. https://lethain.com/doing-it-harder-and-hero-programming/
The intersection I've found between the individual's and their manager's perspective is the career narrative. https://lethain.com/career-narratives/
Once you've identified goals to pursue, the next step is to translate those goals into actions, and this is where your manager can be a leveraged partner in interating on your career narrative. https://lethain.com/career-narratives/
Because level expansion is typically driven more by the need for career progression than by the introduction of objectively distinct accomplishment, levels added at the top create downward pressure on existing levels. https://lethain.com/career-levels-and-more/
This is both a true story from an hour ago, and also a good example of what I think about when I think about vulnerability: sharing more of who you are emotionally than people expect, and often more than they’re comfortable with hearing. https://lethain.com/vulnerability/
These folks have benefited from level expansion at that company aged, and it's hard for them to walk away from that heady cocktail of status, compensation and recognition. https://lethain.com/career-levels-and-more/
A few caveats about process rollouts:  Around the time your team reaches three engineers, you'll want to be running a sprint process. https://lethain.com/tools-for-operating-a-growing-org/
This is especially important for inclusion and maintenance projects, as well as projects run well enough to avoid heroics, which often receive limited recognition. https://lethain.com/inclusion-in-the-first-shift/
The most effective approach I've found for explaining your team's delivery process is to build a kanban board describing the steps that work goes through, and documenting who performs which steps. https://lethain.com/saying-no/
These were teams where folks were willing to disappoint the folks they managed in order to help their peers succeed. https://lethain.com/first-team/
To partner successfully with your manager: Things your manager should know about you: Some managers are easier to keep informed than others, and success hinges on finding the communication mechanism that works for them. https://lethain.com/partnering-with-your-manager/
Following a structured, deliberate approach to sizing and structuring your engineering organization doesn't require unique insight, is learnable, and it works: give it a try. https://lethain.com/how-to-evolve-eng-org/
From a company perspective, it's important to manage level drift explicitly, which makes it possible to apply the shifts consistently. https://lethain.com/career-levels-and-more/
Done over time, you'll get a clear sense of who gets leaned on for the most important projects, and done well you'll see that cohort continue to grow! https://lethain.com/selecting-project-leads/
Your staff meeting either: The mechanism I've found most helpful in this case is ensuring every team has a clear set of directional metrics in an easily discoverable dashboard. https://lethain.com/tools-for-operating-a-growing-org/
Shifting folks across teams can reset the clock on gelling, especially for teams in the early stages of gelling, or if there are significant differences in team culture. https://lethain.com/case-against-top-down-global-optimization/
After you've discovered an effective approach, document the problem you set out to solve, the learning process you went through, and the details of how another team would adopt the practice for themselves. https://lethain.com/model-document-share/
If each of those migrations takes closer to a month, or if they are only possible for your small cadre of trained engineers whose time is already tightly contended for, then the impact becomes far more pronounced. https://lethain.com/productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth/
You'll have many internal candidates. https://lethain.com/internal-candidates-for-senior-management/
First, all thinking should start from a company perspective, and you should make sure that what you're doing is not creating negative externalities for the company or the other teams you work with. https://lethain.com/philosophy-of-management/
Once you've invested so much time into drafting policy, you have to avoid undermining your work, and yourself, with exceptions. https://lethain.com/work-policy-not-exceptions/
Technology exploration is experimenting with a new approach or technology, with clear criteria for adoption beyond the experiment. https://lethain.com/magnitudes-of-exploration/
The hiring funnel consists of four major steps: identifying candidates, motivating them to apply, evaluating them for your company, and closing them on joining. https://lethain.com/hiring-funnel/
Being clear about the level of work required to maintain the existing business lines,   before considering work to create new ones, is powerful because it forces you to   explicitly deprioritize them. https://lethain.com/headcount-dilemmas/
For much of your early career, you'll have folks who are routinely giving feedback on your work. https://lethain.com/setting-organizational-direction/
You'll probably want to more baseline goals than investment goals, but it's easiest to separate them out to avoid bogging down the conversation. https://lethain.com/goals-and-baselines/
As an organizational leader, you'll always have a portfolio of risk, and you'll always be doing very badly at some things that are important to you. https://lethain.com/organizational-risk/
Most companies start out using a single scale to represent performance designations, often whole numbers from one to five. https://lethain.com/perf-management-system/
In a growing company, you should generally round up the number of managers, as this is a calculation "at rest", and your organization will be a living, evolving thing. https://lethain.com/running-an-engineering-reorg/
As a manager, you may have more experience and more access to opportunities within the company, but that represents a small slice of someone's career possibilities. https://lethain.com/career-narratives/
A coworker of mine suggested that some companies have very successfully moved towards the swarming model (at the organization level, not just at the team level), and I'd be fascinated to hear from folks who've successfully gone the other direction! https://lethain.com/case-against-top-down-global-optimization/
Maybe we should start proactively asking every candidate to fill out an anonymous Glassdoor review on their interview experience. https://lethain.com/running-humane-interview-process/
Most companies determine their size by merging momentum and hiring velocity into a projection, but that can create an investment interia that's initially quite reasonable and slowly slips into efficiency. https://lethain.com/how-to-evolve-eng-org/
If you could get training down to four weeks, imagine how quickly you could hire without overwhelming the existing team! https://lethain.com/productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth/
Teams burn out when they are doing too much work, which isn't interesting enough, and without enough recognition. https://lethain.com/healing-team-burnout/
Most teams work best when scoped to approximately eight engineers, so as each team gets to that point, you can move the hiring spigot to another team (or to a new team). https://lethain.com/productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth/
Sign up here for updates on the book, or consider signing up for my weekly summary of blog posts, which will also include updates on An Elegant Puzzle. https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/
Context: if you want to periodically convey a bunch of state on a topic to a wide audience, then write a Context email. https://lethain.com/how-write-group-emails-at-work/
Once you have career ladders and performance designations defined, you need a process to ensure designations are being periodically calculated in a consistent and fair fashion, that process is your performance cycle. https://lethain.com/perf-management-system/
For example, you might do this purely from a financial projections   perspective, then reason about the kinds and quantities of products   or businesses your company would need to met those, and further from   those products to a company size. https://lethain.com/how-to-evolve-eng-org/
You've mentioned to your peers a few times that you've seen Kanban work effectively, but folks tried it two years ago and are still upset whenever the word is mentioned: it just doesn't work here. https://lethain.com/model-document-share/
Your role certainly matters a great deal, with more outwardly facing roles like developer relations  making it easier to meet folks even at smaller companies. https://lethain.com/meeting-people/
This is the organizational sibling of technical debt, and represents things like biased interview processes and inequitable compensation mechanisms. https://lethain.com/organizational-risk/
This number particularly depends on your company's working definintion of an engineering manager's role. https://lethain.com/running-an-engineering-reorg/
As a business' complexity rapidly grows, folks in important organizational roles often struggle to learn quickly enough to remain effective in their current roles. https://lethain.com/growing-with-your-company/
Performance designations are an explicit statement of how an individual is performing against the expectations of their career ladder at their current level over a particular period of time. https://lethain.com/perf-management-system/
A new project can only be started when an existing project is finished, creating a feedback loop preventing us from overwhelming ourselves with unfinished tasks. https://lethain.com/limiting-wip/
The overall team is getting 1.06 engineers of work out of every three engineers. https://lethain.com/productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth/
An effective approach is to prioritize standardization, while explicitly pursuing a bounded number of explorations that are pre-validated to offer a minimum of an order of magnitude improvement over the current standard. https://lethain.com/magnitudes-of-exploration/
Peer-company chats - in addition to chatting with your users, I’ve found it equally valuable to chat with a wide variety of folks working on similar problems at other companies to understand how they’re thinking about things. https://lethain.com/product-management-infra-engineering/
Controls are the mechanisms you use to align with other leaders you work with, and can range from defining metrics to sprint planning (although I wouldn't recommend the later). https://lethain.com/identify-your-controls/
There are two particularly interesting kinds of goals: investments and baselines. https://lethain.com/goals-and-baselines/
As your team gets larger and the number of stakeholders you're working with grows, you'll also want to develop a roadmap describing your high-level plans over the next three to twelve months. https://lethain.com/tools-for-operating-a-growing-org/
As a team's direct manager, you can use this to ground concerns around individuals who might not be ramping up successfully, and as you move into middle management, sprints are useful for debugging within your organization. https://lethain.com/tools-for-operating-a-growing-org/
A few additional tips that I've found especially useful: Like other leadership tools, a vision or strategy document is a solution to a specific set of problems, and they're not always useful. https://lethain.com/strategies-visions/
Worse, the reward loop of fighting fires is more immediate and more powerful than the reward loop of doing durably good work, and folks rapidly come to believe it's the correct way for a team to function. https://lethain.com/fire-fixation/
Sure, time management isn't always everyone's biggest challenge, but once the crises of the day recede, it comes to the fore. https://lethain.com/time-management/
A good vision is composed of: Put all these pieces together, and you've crafted a document that is a guiding hand to align decisions while also creating room for teams to make their own choices and tradeoffs along the way. https://lethain.com/strategies-visions/
This might mean pushing back on a timeline which would force your team into a death march, even though it's uncomfortable to have that conversation with your manager or your product partner. https://lethain.com/philosophy-of-management/
I've been hiring engineering manager of managers roles over the past six months. https://lethain.com/internal-candidates-for-senior-management/
When I worked at Yahoo,  it had reached such a large size that many folks didn't interact across teams, which meant  that I ended up not meeting too many folks there despite being a company of thirteen thousand. https://lethain.com/meeting-people/
You'd expect that novel ideas would be heavily valued in these circumstances, but interestingly it's the opposite: execution is the primary currency in the growth plates. https://lethain.com/managing-growth-plates/
In that case, the next step isn't investing more energy in explaining your constraints, but instead to work on how you partner with your individual stakeholders. https://lethain.com/saying-no/
If the distribution of grades shifts down, you can drill into which input metric caused that shift, and use that to identify corrective action. https://lethain.com/metrics-for-the-unmeasurable/
With less time soaked by maintenance, we’ve scurried to understand our users’ needs and define an optimistic, future-facing roadmap to support them. https://lethain.com/product-management-infra-engineering/
Know that internal processes are awkward. https://lethain.com/internal-candidates-for-senior-management/
Take your list and for each item try to identify the folks who could readily take on that work. https://lethain.com/succession-planning/
Ultimately you and your team are being judged on your contribution to the company, and you generate that value by successfully executing on useful projects. https://lethain.com/adding-value-as-an-engineering-manager/
We've done a few things differently than I've seen in previous attempts, and I think they've made the reading groups meaningfully more valuable. https://lethain.com/hosting-paper-reading-group/
If things don't quite work for this format in your company, then watch how other folks present. https://lethain.com/presenting-to-executives/
Transitions are opportunities to raise the floor by building competency in new skills, and in stable periods you can raise the ceiling by developing mastery in the skills that new era values. https://lethain.com/roles-over-rocket-ships/
My approach lately has been creating synthetic metrics, which package input metrics into a useful abstraction. https://lethain.com/metrics-for-the-unmeasurable/
Running this process, and the awkwardness in doing so, is the most rewarding thing I've done this year. https://lethain.com/internal-candidates-for-senior-management/
My experiences working with new managers, combined with my own flailing, have lead me to develop a somewhat unusual approach to management, centered on providing strong standard rails to raise the floor for performance and outcomes. https://lethain.com/rails-for-engineering-leadership/
If you fit heavily on individual asks, you'll end up doing frequent reorganizations as folks' preferences evolve and new folks are added into the organization. https://lethain.com/special-topics-org-design/
Effective derisking is essential, because each team that endorses a migration is making a bet on you that you're going to get this damn thing done, and not leave them with a migration to an abandoned system that they have to revert. https://lethain.com/migrations/
Converting your size into your structure is then a simple process: For example, imagine you have sixty engineers: Starting with the largest containers first, ususally organizations, recursively balance the areas of responsibility across the containers. https://lethain.com/how-to-evolve-eng-org/
This is problematic because it undermines   your largest business lines, and also because the delta between required and provided   resources is paid through technical, product or organizational debt. https://lethain.com/headcount-dilemmas/
Not all of these are classically great books, some are even a bit dull to read, but they've changed how I think in a meaningful way. https://lethain.com/best-books/
Talk to folks at your company who have worked at different kinds of companies and ask what those companies did really well. https://lethain.com/setting-organizational-direction/
An organization's size is just a number, its structure is how the pieces fit together and accomplish useful things. https://lethain.com/how-to-evolve-eng-org/
Absolutely not–there are periods of change when you will need to overhaul your team or organization to adapt it to new circumstances and constraints–but if you are always working extremely hard, then your organization is probably too dependent on you. https://lethain.com/adding-value-as-an-engineering-manager/
I've found it most fruitful to move scope between teams, preserving the teams themselves. https://lethain.com/case-against-top-down-global-optimization/
You put in more time, learn more, and your metric selection becomes a durable, useful materialization of the reality underneath. https://lethain.com/metrics-for-the-unmeasurable/
I can guarantee two things about that effort: first, that it took years of grueling effort, and that the team working on that migration did not feel appreciated for those years of labor. https://lethain.com/healing-team-burnout/
If not, I've found it useful to borrow the approach of a sampling profiler: for a week, check what your team is working on at a few random moments across the day, and use that as an approximation of where time is being spent. https://lethain.com/saying-no/
For example, your goaled metric might be: 80% of servers have a security grade of A, up from 60% in Q4, hitting our goal of 75%. https://lethain.com/metrics-for-the-unmeasurable/
Ten different folks can try the same approach with ten distinct results, so success stems from figuring out what works well for you personally. https://lethain.com/meeting-people/
We've been doing weekly cold sourcing meetings as a partnership between our engineering managers and engineering recruiters, and it's been a great forum for learning, empathy building and, of course, hiring. https://lethain.com/cold-sourcing/
Good metrics require a deep understanding of the data underneath, and building that familiarity is real work. https://lethain.com/metrics-for-the-unmeasurable/
In aggregate, this leads to a dynamic where there is very little low-hanging fruit to reduce technical debt, and most remaining options require many teams working together to implement them: migrations. https://lethain.com/migrations/
Later, as your new heroes finish martyring themselves on burnout, you're left with three exceptionally challenging problems: This is a recurring pattern that many growing companies fall into, and it also occurs to projects within larger companies. https://lethain.com/doing-it-harder-and-hero-programming/
How many teams should we have? https://lethain.com/sizing-engineering-teams/
The other scenario that typically leads to level expansion is hiring of very senior folks from other, typically older, companies. https://lethain.com/career-levels-and-more/
Lately, I've come to have something of a mantra for guiding decision making: do the right thing for the company, the right thing for the team, and the right thing for you, in that order. https://lethain.com/philosophy-of-management/
